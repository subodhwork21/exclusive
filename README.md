# CoWork

**CoWork** is a single-page website designed to provide users with essential information about shared workspaces. The site is built using **Next.js**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, delivering a clean and responsive user interface. It focuses on simplicity and usability, offering a seamless experience for users looking to explore coworking spaces.

## Project Overview

For this project, I handled the front-end development based on a design sourced online. My primary role was to bring the design to life by coding the layout and styling, ensuring that the interface is both clean and responsive. The site is intended to give users easy access to workspace details while providing an elegant and efficient browsing experience.

## Features

- **Single-Page Design**: Provides all necessary information about coworking spaces in one easy-to-navigate page.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for different screen sizes to ensure a smooth experience across various devices.
- **Clean and Modern UI**: Focused on delivering a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and improved performance.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring the website and defining the layout and styles.
- **JavaScript** (optional for future features): Placeholder for adding interactivity.

## Project Structure

- **public/**: Contains static assets like images and icons used in the site.
- **styles/**: Contains CSS files responsible for the design, layout, and responsiveness of the website.
- **pages/**: Houses the Next.js pages, which in this case is focused on the single-page structure.
- **index.js**: Main JavaScript file that renders the homepage and connects layout elements.
